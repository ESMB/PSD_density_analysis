Code to run super-resolution analysis, cluster and then perform distance analysis (as in Broadhead et al. 2016). 

- First, place SR images into a directory and then run SR.ijm on them. 
	Output: SuperRes.tif (SR image), FitResults.txt (coords etc.), _details.txt. 

- Next, run Cluster.py

	Outputs: Clustered super-resolution images and denity images etc.
